# Research Statement
As someone who is enthusiastic about the research enterprise, I look forward to establishing a research program that provides opportunities for intellectual discovery, outreach/education, and innovation. My approach to research is both highly interdisciplinary and thematically focused on the complexity of biological and cognitive processes. With both research and educational experience in multiple traditional fields of science, I have gained the ability to lead research that is both integrative and transformative. I also have experience conducting research in many different settings, from large, interdisciplinary groups to two-person collaborations and independent research. This extensive research background has prepared me to push the frontiers of scientific discovery.  

## Topical Interests and Background<br>
From a topical perspective, I am broadly interested in development, evolution, cognition, and complex systems. I started my career at the interface the Anthropological, Cognitive, and Biological Sciences. In order to integrate these interests, I embraced the tools and techniques of Computational Science. As a practical research agenda, I spent time learning the technical aspects of molecular, cell, and organismal biology while also learning various computational techniques. This goes well beyond the standard bioinformatics approach, and includes research in the areas of data science, virtual reality, and mathematical modeling. Over the course of my career, my training on multiple fronts has translated into both novel research outcomes and an appreciation for different scientific points-of-view. One highlight of how this perspective can yield high-profile research is the Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper [“Virtual Reality in Neuroscience Research and Therapy”](https://osf.io/n2xvp/). By combining perspecives from applied Computer Science, Psychology, Communication, and Applied Physiology, my colleagues and I were able to address an emerging research topic in a way that made a major contribution to the field.

Having conducted research in multiple fields before formally earning a PhD, my dissertation research was conducted in the area of Cellular Plasticity and Cellular Reprogramming. As an exemplar of the broad but integrative perspective I bring to scientific research, [“Reprogramming to the Nervous System”](https://osf.io/v7dnk) features empirical studies, computational models, and cross-species comparisons. The research completed for this dissertation involved both innovative molecular techniques and bioinformatics. The associated knowledge has synthesized and advanced understanding in the areas of cellular stemness properties and the cellular reprogramming process as it relates to the derivation of induced pluripotent (iPS), neuronal (iN), and skeletal muscle (iSM) cells. It is this strength in intellectual synthesis coupled with data analysis that marks my rather unique way of approaching empirical problems.

After the PhD, I began working at the intersection of development, evolution, and computational modeling. For the past two years, I have been working with the [OpenWorm Foundation](http://openworm.org) to develop models and data analysis techniques related to _Caenorhabditis elegans_ embryogenesis. This has resulted in the creation of an OpenWorm Foundation subgroup called [DevoWorm](http://devoworm.weebly.com/). As a senior contributor and project organizer, I have gained experience with managing multiple lines of research, mentoring both undergraduates and graduate students, and realizing collaborative visions in the form of tangible scholarship. OpenWorm has provided me with an avenue for both research and pedagogy, as well as a means to develop a research infrastructure in computational biology.

## Laboratory Structure and Research Plan<br>
Having worked on a number of independent and collaborative research projects over the past few years has enabled me to establish the Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory. While currently managed entirely through the use of project management tools and interpersonal collaborations, the Orthogonal Laboratory infrastructure is ready to implement in a University setting. Orthogonal Lab currently houses collaborative and single investigator-driven research in the areas of data science, cognitive systems, computational cell/molecular biology, and biological theory. In addition, the Orthogonal Laboratory has cultivated two research groups that have already yielded scientific advances in the form of papers and data as well as education-related experiences.  

A primary mission of the Orthogonal Laboratory is to produce cutting-edge research and provide educational opportunities in the areas of data modeling/analysis, systems analysis, and theoretical development. The University version of the Orthogonal Laboratory will consist of three components: the analysis of biological and cognitive data gathered through collaboration, establishing links between data analysis, computational methods, and theoretical development, and a virtual presence. In particular, our biological data and theory synthesis will focus on utilizing data science and computational representations to answer a host of questions regarding behavior, development, evolution, and biological self-organization. 

Between these resources and on-campus collaborations, Orthogonal Lab will also provide new research opportunities in a variety of areas. One research theme consists of the [DevoWorm](https://devoworm.weebly.com/) research group. The DevoWorm group has done significant work on exploring the comparative and systems-level aspects of development, with a focus on the nematode _C. elegans_. This includes opportunities in the areas of developmental dynamics, the simulation of morphogenetic processes, and the study of reproductive and developmental plasticity. Another Orthogonal Lab research theme consists of the [Representational Brains and Phenotypes](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/) research group. Representational Brains and Phenotypes involves developing computational approaches and theoretical models that help us better understand the connections between organismal biology and behavior. The group's activities involve a mix of simulation, systems-level representation, data science, and experimental approaches.

Orthogonal Lab is also defined by an active educational and outreach component. Part of this infrastructure includes the development of a [laboratory contribution philosophy](https://osf.io/7twnu/) to encourage retention of and optimal participation by diverse scientific talent. There will be also be ample opportunities to participate in scientific software development and neuroinformatic data analysis through connections to the [OpenWorm Foundation](http://www.openworm.org/). One overarching theme in the Orthogonal Laboratory is a commitment to Open Science. This includes both a [commitment to transparency](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/sci-infrastructure.html) as well as a [digital media presence](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/media.html). The former (transparency) is exemplified by the advancement of open science scholarship and practice. The latter (digital media) provides a means to extend our research to a broader audience of potential collaborators, non-traditional funders, and non-scientists.

Near-term agenda for Orthogonal Research Laboratory. Items can be expanded or contracted as opportunities present themselves.
</p>

In the far future, this research agenda and its underlying funding will be greatly improved by a University presence. Part of this plan for growth involves growing and sustaining the DevoWorm project through local (on-campus) collaborations. Another part of this plan involves establishing linkages between the Orthogonal Lab, the OpenWorm Foundation, and the University community. In its current form, DevoWorm is a distributed, collaborative project. Once it is formally part in an academic laboratory, the DevoWorm group will have a hand in a wider variety of data sources, in addition to having access to more sophisticated primary modes of data collection. The techniques developed for DevoWorm could also be transferred to other emerging projects both within and outside the lab.

I also seek to build collaborations and educational opportunities that emphasize the interdisciplinary connections between computational science, biological science, and cognitive/brain sciences. Immediately, this would contribute to the development of additional expertise in the Representational Brains and Phenotypes group. From a more general perspective, synergies with students, collaborators, and funding opportunities will refine the scope and content of our scientific investigations, in addition to the development of more sophisticated methods of computational modeling and analysis.

## Broader Contributions<br>
One of my organizational goals in a faculty position is to be engaged in the interdisciplinary opportunities across campus. This is not only reflected in collaborations or inclusion of different disciplinary perspectives, but also involves building an infrastructure based on intellectual cross-fertilization. Additionally, I am motivated to use many of those interdisciplinary benefits as a bridge to bolster opportunities in the home Department. One such avenue is in promoting the participation of underrepresented groups both in the Laboratory setting and across campus. This includes both strategies for retention and career development.

A second organizational goal is to serve as a resource for methodological expertise. I am particularly interested in imparting and catalyzing skills in open science practice, theoretical synthesis, and innovation in techniques for data analysis. This could be in conjunction with both department-wide and campus-wide outreach. As in the case of promoting interdisciplinary interactions, this could be a resource for both instruction and professional development.
