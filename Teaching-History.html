<p>MMG  302:  Laboratory  Instructor,  General  Microbiology  Laboratory,  Department  of  Microbiology  and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, Spring and Summer 2012.</p>
<p>The teaching task was to supervise students during a laboratory practicum. Students wrote up reports on their exercises and received feedback from the instructor. The course had 16-24 students per section, and the degree of student-instructor interaction was high. </p>
<p>QB  828:  Module  on  Evolutionary  Systems  Biology,  Biology  for  the  Interdisciplinary  Scientist, Quantitative Biology Program, Michigan State University, Spring 2009 and Spring 2010. </p>
<p>The teaching task was to introduce and engage quantitative-oriented students (e.g. physicists, engineers) to evolutionary biology. The course was developed as a module of an existing course on Quantitative Biology methods. The module consists of a series of lectures, homework assignments, and exam questions. The course had 10-14 students per year, and the degree of student-instructor interaction was high. </p>
